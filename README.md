# nBloons TD 5
A recreation of the popular Bloons Tower Defense 5 for the Ti-Nspire calculator. This is based heavily upon the Ndless software.

## Installation
Make sure you have [ndless](https://ndless.me) installed on your calculator before you begin this. Then, using a TI calculator to computer transfer software such as [TI-Nspire Computer Link Software](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/82035809F7E6474099944056CCB01C20/ti-nspire_computerlink) while having the calculator to computer USB cable plugged in as shown below, transfer the .tns file.

If you have ndless installed correctly, then you should be able to just click on the transfered file on the calculator and have the game start up.

## Building
In order to build the program yourself, you must have the Ndless SDK installed. If you do not, follow the instructions on [hackspire](https://hackspire.org/index.php?title=C_and_assembly_development_introduction). Then in a terminal window that is in the directory of the folder with the Makefile, just type `make clean; make;` to build.
